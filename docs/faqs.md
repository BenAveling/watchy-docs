### Which side is the front/back of the E-Ink display?

The front is the side that's whitish gray, with a white bezel at the bottom. The back is the metallic and mirror-line.

### I stuck on the screen the wrong way, help!

- **Do Not Pry Off the Screen!** It is made of glass and prying it off the strong adhesive will definitely crack it
- There is a screen protector on the screen (you can life it off with the green tab), try to lift it off to save your screen
- You can also slide a thin hobby knife between the screen and the PCB to remove the adhesive. Work slowly!
- Check out this video on Badgy for reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BzPnMsKN20

### Why does my display appear "static-y"

- **Make sure you are using the latest version of the GxEDP2 library (i.e. > 1.2.16)** , there is a fix for the GDEH0154D67 display
- Ensure the FPC cable is fully inserted, and the lock is in place

### I have another issue, could you help me out?

- Open an issue on our [Github](https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy/issues), provide additional details on your setup (e.g. OS, Arduino Version, etc.) and photos of your Watchy
